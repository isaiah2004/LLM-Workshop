# Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are computerized language models consisting of an artificial neural network with many parameters, trained on large quantities of unlabeled text using self-supervised learning or semi-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks.

## What is Lang chain

In their own words -

> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an api, but will also:
> 1. Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
> 2. Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment
